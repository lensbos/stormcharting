Simple ASP.NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0 Charting Library that offers configurable Bar, Line and Pie charts.  Configuration is provided using an XML configuration file.  Chart data can be supplied via an XML data file.

The library is developed in C# and the controls are implemented as web user controls.

The library should be ported to .NET 2.0, and certainly numerous enhancements can be made to the project.  At this point, it is quite stable under .NET 1.1.
